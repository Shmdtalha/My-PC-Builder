# MyPCBuilder
 SDA Project

Getting a laptop or a desktop is a very hectic process, especially in third world countries where used PCs have a higher demand than new ones. There are problems like: 

●	Researching about different computer components and comparing them in a single platform. Hard to choose between prices, specs, speeds etc.
●	Looking for those components. Some components are not available. Some are not upto the mark and are falsely advertised.

The PC parts catalog software will be a software-based application that is easy to navigate and use.  
It will simplify the component selection process, ensure compatibility, and provide users with a hassle-free buying experience.
It will include a wide range of PC components, including CPUs, GPUs, RAM, motherboards, storage devices, and power supplies, from different manufacturers. 
The software will allow users to select and configure their PC build, and it will ensure that all components are compatible with each other.
One of the primary features of the software will be the cost estimator, which will calculate the total cost of the selected components, including taxes and shipping costs. 
The cost estimator will also allow users to compare prices of different components.


List of 5 to 10 Main Features:

1.	A software that allows users to select pc components to build PCs
2.	Comparing different components; price, model, specs, colours
3.	Compatibility checking (Check the compatibility of selected components to avoid any issues during the assembly process)
4.	Other details displayed as well (warranties, Taxes?shipping fees?)
5.	RL links to direct people to component sites when they need more information
6.	Utility software links for each component ( Eg. Nvidia GeForce)
7.	Component recommendations: Suggest alternative components based on the user's budget or performance requirements
8.	Build sharing (Enable users to save their build configurations and share them with others for feedback)
9.	Cost estimator, which will calculate the total cost of the selected components, including taxes and shipping costs
